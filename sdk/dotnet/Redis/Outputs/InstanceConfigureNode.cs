        /// Set the availability zone to which the node belongs. The number of nodes of an instance (i.e., NodeNumber) and the availability zone deployment scheme (i.e., the value of the MultiAZ parameter) will affect the filling of the current parameter. Among them:
        /// When a new instance is a single-node instance (i.e., the value of NodeNumber is 1), only a single availability zone deployment scheme is allowed (i.e., the value of MultiAZ must be disabled). At this time, only one availability zone needs to be passed in AZ, and all nodes in the instance will be deployed in this availability zone. When creating a new instance as a primary-standby instance (that is, when the value of NodeNumber is greater than or equal to 2), the number of availability zones passed in must be equal to the number of nodes in a single shard (that is, the value of the NodeNumber parameter), and the value of AZ must comply with the multi-availability zone deployment scheme rules. The specific rules are as follows: If the primary-standby instance selects the multi-availability zone deployment scheme (that is, the value of MultiAZ is enabled), then at least two different availability zone IDs must be passed in in AZ, and the first availability zone is the availability zone where the primary node is located. If the primary and standby instances choose a single availability zone deployment scheme (that is, the value of MultiAZ is disabled), then the availability zones passed in for each node must be the same.
